Shipping Integration with USPS
=====================================

This documentation illustrates how shipment carrier costs via USPS can
be calculated. It also explains how to generate shipping labels.

If USPS is offered as a shipping option, customers can check USPS 
shipping rates at checkout, for delivery to their selected address. 
To provide this service, register for a USPS Web Tools user ID,
and activate USPS within tryton module. 

The module assumes that an account on USPS has been created and following
information is available:

* USPS User ID
* USPS User Password

Once all these details have been configured out, customers can select the USPS
Shipping rates during checkout. The USPS shipping label can also be generated.
